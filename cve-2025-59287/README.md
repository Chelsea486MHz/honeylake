# CVE-2025-59287 (WSUS RCE)

This honeypot emulates a vulnerable Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server to catch CVE-2025-59287 exploitation attempts

## Architecture

- **An NGINX reverse proxy (TCP 8530/8531)** emulating IIS/WSUS endpoints with realistic headers and self-signed certs
- **A Flask backend (TCP 8081)** acting as the actual honeypot

## Further disguising

If you have access to a real WSUS server, you can copy its `wsdl` files to better disguise the honeypot.

```bash
curl http://wsus-server:8530/ClientWebService/Client.asmx?wsdl > Client.wsdl
curl http://wsus-server:8530/ReportingWebService/ReportingWebService.asmx?wsdl > Reporting.wsdl
curl http://wsus-server:8530/SimpleAuthWebService/SimpleAuth.asmx?wsdl > SimpleAuth.wsdl
curl http://wsus-server:8530/ApiRemoting30/WebService.asmx?wsdl > ApiRemoting.wsdl
```

## Changelog

6/11/2025: More realistic server emulating more endpoints and serving basic static files. Threat actors were scanning for such files to avoid honeypots...
